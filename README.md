# Down Golf üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ≥

A unique 2D platforming and golfing game created for Ludum Dare 57 game jam with the theme "depths".

## About the Game

Down Golf combines platforming mechanics with golf gameplay. Players must navigate through 2D platforming levels while also getting their golf ball to the hole. The twist? Each new level takes you deeper below the previous one, creating an ever-descending challenge.
